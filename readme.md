### CSCI596 Final Project

For assignment 7, most students preferred the more straightforward option and used VMD software to post-process a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. As the first step of our project, we used a C/OpenGL program to animate the simulation results. Please open `animation1.MOV` to review the result.

Although the animation presents a general understanding about the atoms, there is no visual characteristic to help us distinguish them. Therefore, we decided to show the 3D velocity of atoms using the RGB color cube. This extension of assignment 7 could be useful to present the simulation results in a more intuitive and informative way. Please open `animation2.MOV` to view the result.
